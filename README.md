# TeachFlow
My intent is to create an application that teachers can use for tracking grades, notes, homework, contacts, and other important info for their classrooms. 
It will initially be a computer java application, but I eventually hope to add mobile apps, a website, and (obviously) server data storage rather than the initial local storage. 
Use of any of my code for a layout or template or a starting point is totally allowed(tho not sure why anyone would want such shoddy workmanship lol). Open Source is truly free for the world. #NetNeutrality2k17
